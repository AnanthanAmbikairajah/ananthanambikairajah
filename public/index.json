This difference in vulnerability could be explained at least in part by the variability in DNA repair mechanisms’ efficiency between individuals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test associations between documented, prevalent genetic variation (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP) in DNA repair genes, cognitive function, and brain structure. Community-living participants (n = 488,159; 56.54 years (8.09); 54.2% female) taking part in the UK Biobank study and for whom cognitive and genetic measures were available were included. SNPs in base excision repair (BER) genes of the bifunctional DNA glycosylases OGG1 (rs1052133, rs104893751), NEIL1 (rs7402844, rs5745906), NEIL2 (rs6601606), NEIL3 (rs10013040, rs13112390, rs13112358, rs1395479), MUTYH (rs34612342, rs200165598), NTHL1 (rs150766139, rs2516739) were considered. Cognitive measures included fluid intelligence, the symbol–digit matching task, visual matching, and trail-making. Hierarchical regression and latent class analyses were used to test the associations between SNPs and cognitive measures. Associations between SNPs and brain measures were also tested in a subset of 39,060 participants. Statistically significant associations with cognition were detected for 12 out of the 13 SNPs analyzed. The strongest effects amounted to a 1–6% difference in cognitive function detected for NEIL1 (rs7402844), NEIL2 (rs6601606), and NTHL1 (rs2516739). Associations varied by age and sex, with stronger effects detected in middle-aged women. Weaker associations with brain measures were also detected. Variability in some BER genes is associated with cognitive function and brain structure and may explain variability in the risk for neurodegeneration and dementia.\nCitation: Cherbuin, N.; Patel, H.; Walsh, E.I.; Ambikairajah, A.; Burns, R.; Brüstle, A.; Rasmussen, L.J.

Poor cardiometabolic health is further linked to microvascular brain lesions, which can be detected as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) using T2-FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Females show higher risk for WMHs post-menopause, but it remains unclear whether changes in cardiometabolic risk factors underlie menopause-related increase in brain pathology. Methods: In this study, we assessed whether cross-sectional measures of cardiometabolic health, including body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), blood lipids, blood pressure, and long-term blood glucose (HbA1c), as well as longitudinal changes in BMI and WHR, differed according to menopausal status at baseline in 9,882 UK Biobank females (age range 40–70 years, n premenopausal = 3,529, n postmenopausal = 6,353). Furthermore, we examined whether these cardiometabolic factors were associated with WMH outcomes at the follow-up assessment, on average 8.78 years after baseline. Results: Postmenopausal females showed higher levels of baseline blood lipids (HDL b = 0.14, p , 0.001, LDL b = 0.20, p , 0.001, triglycerides b = 0.12, p , 0.001) and HbA1c (b = 0.24, p , 0.001) compared to premenopausal women, beyond the effects of age. Over time, BMI increased more in the premenopausal compared to the postmenopausal group (b = −0.08, p , 0.001), while WHR increased to a similar extent in both groups (b = −0.03, p = 0.102). The change in WHR was however driven by increased waist circumference only in the premenopausal group. While the group level changes in BMI and WHR were in general small, these ﬁndings point to distinct anthropometric changes in pre- and postmenopausal females over time. Higher baseline measures of BMI, WHR, triglycerides, blood pressure, and HbA1c, as well as longitudinal increases in BMI and WHR, were associated with larger WMH volumes (b range = 0.03–0.13, p ≤ 0.002). HDL showed a signiﬁcant inverse relationship with WMH volume (b = −0.27, p , 0.001). Discussion: Our ﬁndings emphasise the importance of monitoring cardiometabolic risk factors in females from midlife through the menopause transition and into the postmenopausal phase, to ensure improved cerebrovascular outcomes in later years.\nCitation: Schindler, L.

This study included UK Biobank (n = 29,545; mean age = 54.65) participants at imaging visit with sleep measures and brain scans, and a subset (n = 14,206) with cognitive measures. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to study the associations between sleep and brain health. Every additional hour of sleep above 7 h/day was associated with 0.10–0.25% lower brain volumes. In contrast, a negative non-linear association was observed between sleep duration, grey matter, and hippocampal volume. Both longer (\u0026gt; 9 h/day) and shorter sleep (\u0026lt; 6 h/day) durations were associated with lower brain volumes and cognitive measures (memory, reaction time, fluid intelligence). Additionally, daytime dozing was associated with lower brain volumes (grey matter and left hippocampus volume) and lower cognitive measures (reaction time and fluid intelligence). Poor sleep (\u0026lt; 6 h/day, \u0026gt; 9 h/day, daytime dozing) at midlife was associated with lower brain health.

Therefore, the present study aimed to review and discuss critical developments in menopause nomenclature; determine the level of heterogeneity amongst menopause definitions and compare them with the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria.\nMethods: Definitions/criteria used to characterise premenopausal and postmenopausal status were extracted from 210 studies and 128 of these studies were included in the final analyses.\nResults: The main findings were that 39.84% of included studies were consistent with STRAW classification of premenopause, whereas 70.31% were consistent with STRAW classification of postmenopause. Surprisingly, major inconsistencies relating to premenopause definition were due to a total lack of reporting of any definitions/criteria for premenopause (39.84% of studies). In contrast, only 20.31% did not report definitions/criteria for postmenopause.\nConclusion: There is a significant amount of heterogeneity associated with the definition of premenopause, compared with postmenopause. We propose three key suggestions/recommendations, which can be distilled from these findings. Firstly, premenopause should be transparently operationalised and reported. Secondly, as a minimum requirement, regular menstruation should be defined as the number of menstrual cycles in a period of at least 3 months. Finally, the utility of introducing normative age-ranges as supplementary criterion for defining stages of reproductive ageing should be considered. The use of consistent terminology in research will enhance our capacity to compare results from different studies and more effectively investigate issues related to women\u0026rsquo;s health and ageing.\nCitation: Ambikairajah, A., Walsh, E., \u0026amp; Cherbuin, N.

Therefore, we aimed to determine whether the implementation of a single pedagogical strategy, centred within the self-determination theory framework, could effectively address students’ innate need for relatedness. Specifically, informal verbal feedback was utilised to enhance teacher-student communication, where the teacher spoke with each undergraduate student individually at the start of every lesson for 1-2 minutes. A total of 243 Advanced Science undergraduates enrolled in a first year course were included in the study. Seventy-one undergraduates were enrolled in 2016 whereas 172 undergraduates were enrolled in 2017. A mixed research methodology was employed to best leverage the utility of both qualitative and quantitative data. Interestingly, the use of informal verbal feedback as a pedagogical strategy significantly improved student perceptions of receiving helpful feedback to aid their learning. These findings are important as they emphasise the importance and feasibility of implementing one new pedagogical strategy to facilitate student motivation, by enhancing feelings of relatedness.\nCitation: Ambikairajah, A., Ambikairajah, R., \u0026amp; Ambikairajah, E.

Multiple linear hierarchical regression models were computed to quantify the cross-sectional association between measures of menstruation history and brain volume. Sensitivity analysis based on propensity matching for age (and other demographic/health covariates) were applied to estimate differences in brain volumes between matched premenopausal and postmenopausal women.\nRESULTS: Postmenopausal women had 1.06% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 1.05 – 1.06) and 2.17% (95% CI, 2.12 – 2.22) larger total brain (TBV) and hippocampal volumes (HV), respectively, than premenopausal women. Sensitivity analysis with age matched samples produced consistent results (i.e. TBV: 0.82%, 95% CI, 0.25 – 1.38 ; HV: 1.33%, 95% CI, 0.01 – 2.63). For every year increase in age above 45, postmenopausal women experienced 0.23% greater reduction in TBV than premenopausal women (95% CI, -0.60 - -0.14), which was not observed for HV. Moreover, every 1 year delayed onset of menopause after 45 was associated with 0.32% (95% CI, -0.35 - -0.28) and 0.31% (95% CI, -0.40 - -0.22) smaller TBV and HV, respectively. Every additional year in age of menarche was associated with 0.10% (95% CI, 0.04 – 0.16) larger TBV, which was not detected for HV. Similarly, every 1 year increase in duration of reproductive stage was associated with 0.09% smaller TBV (95% CI, -0.15 – -0.03), which was not detected for HV.\nCONCLUSIONS: Menopause may contribute to brain volume beyond typical aging effects. Furthermore, early age of menarche, delayed age of menopause and increasing duration of reproductive stage were negatively associated with brain volume. Further research is required to determine whether the negative association between age of menopause and HV is potentially an indicator of future vulnerability for dementia.\nCitation: Ambikairajah, A., Tabatabaei-Jafari, H., Hornberger, M., \u0026amp; Cherbuin, N.

No interactive effects were observed between menopausal status and age across all fat mass measures.\nConclusions: The change in fat mass quantity between premenopausal and postmenopausal women was predominantly attributable to increasing age with menopause having no significant additional influence. However, the decrease in total leg fat percentage and increase in measures of central fat are indicative of a possible change in fat mass distribution after menopause. These changes are likely to, at least in part, be due to hormonal shifts that occur during midlife with women having a higher androgen (i.e. testosterone) to estradiol ratio after menopause, which has been linked to enhanced central adiposity deposition. Evidently, these findings suggest attention should be paid to the accumulation of central fat after menopause, whereas increases in total fat mass should be monitored consistently across the lifespan.\nCitation: Ambikairajah, A., Walsh, E., Tabatabaei-Jafari, H., \u0026amp; Cherbuin, N.

We deepen our understanding of the design, reception, and effectiveness of e-exams for history and philosophy of science modules, undertaken by first-year advanced science and medical science students at university. We employ a quasi-experimental research design approach to examine our implementation of e-exams on reported student satisfaction regarding the suitability of the information provided about the assessment requirements, appropriateness of the assessment methods, and overall quality of the associated courses. We report statistically significant increases in student satisfaction regarding the suitability and appropriateness of the assessment methods or requirements. The outcomes of this research highlight new avenues for educators to explore including (a) the innovative use of associated software (Maple TA™) for e-exams and (b) the implications that e-exams can have on the student experience in the context of medium-stakes testing.\nCitation: Ambikairajah, A., \u0026amp; Tisdell, C.

MIC-1/GDF15 is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and increased levels of MIC-1/GDF15 are associated with a variety of diseases including cognitive decline. Furthermore, Mic-1/Gdf15 knockout mice (Mic-1 KO) weigh more, have increased adiposity, associated with increased spontaneous food intake, and exhibit reduced basal energy expenditure and physical activity. The current study was designed to comprehensively determine the role of MIC-1/GDF15 on behavioural domains of male and female knockout mice including locomotion, exploration, anxiety, cognition, social behaviours, and sensorimotor gating. Mic-1 KO mice exhibited a task-dependent increase in locomotion and exploration and reduced anxiety-related behaviours across tests. Spatial working memory and social behaviours were not affected by Mic-1/Gdf15 deficiency. Interestingly, knockout mice formed an increased association with the conditioned stimulus in fear conditioning testing and also displayed significantly improved prepulse inhibition. Overall sex effects were evident for social behaviours, fear conditioning, and sensorimotor gating. This is the first study defining the role of Mic-1/Gdf15 in a number of behavioural domains. Whether the observed impact is based on direct actions of Mic-1/Gdf15 deficiency on the CNS or whether the behavioural effects are mediated by indirect actions on e.g. other neurotransmitter systems must be clarified in future studies.\nCitation: Low, J.

MRI images of 100 participants (33 ALS, 11 ALS-FTD, 22 bvFTD and 34 controls) were rated in four brain areas: orbitofrontal cortex, anterior temporal pole, anterior cingulate, and motor cortex. Areas were rated on a 5- point Likert scale by two raters blinded to the diagnosis. Results demonstrated that bvFTD patients showed the highest levels of atrophy across all regions, while ALS patients had the lowest atrophy scores. ALS-FTD patients have higher atrophy ratings compared to ALS patients for the motor cortex, anterior cingulate and anterior temporal lobe, with a statistical trend for the orbitofrontal cortex. ALS-FTD patients were not significantly different from bvFTD for any of the brain regions. These findings were confirmed in a post hoc VBM analysis of the same participants. Our study demonstrates that a simple visual MRI rating scale can reliably distinguish ALS, ALS-FTD and bvFTD atrophy patterns in a clinical setting. Motor cortex, anterior cingulate and anterior temporal atrophy emerged as good diagnostic markers for ALS-FTD. Employment of this MRI rating scale can complement clinical diagnostics of patients in the ALS-FTD continuum.\nCitation: Ambikairajah, A., Devenney, E., Flanagan, E., Yew, B., Mioshi, E., Kiernan, M.
