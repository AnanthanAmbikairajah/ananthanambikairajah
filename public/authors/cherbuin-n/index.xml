      <description>Abstract
Objectives: To determine lipid profile differences between premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Method: The present review utilised a meta-analytic approach. 66 studies were included, which provided a total sample of 114,655 women consisting of 68,394 that were premenopausal and 46,261 that were postmenopausal.
Results: The main findings were that (1) lipoproteins were significantly higher in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women including triglycerides (0.27 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.</description>

      <title>Fat mass changes during menopause: a meta-analysis</title>

      <description>Abstract
Background: Fat mass has been shown to increase in ageing women, however, the extent to which menopausal status mediates these changes remains unclear.
Objectives: To determine (i) how fat mass differs in quantity and distribution between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, (ii) whether and how age and/or menopausal status moderates any observed differences and (iii) which type of fat mass measure is best suited to detecting differences in fat mass between groups.</description>
