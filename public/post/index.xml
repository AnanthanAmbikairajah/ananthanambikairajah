      <description>National Science Week is drawing to a close and last night I had the pleasure of watching Professor Veena Sahajwalla from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney and Dr Karl Kruszelnicki from the University of Sydney (USyd), give extremely passionate and engaging talks at the National Convention Centre in Canberra. Topics were diverse and ranged from explaining current and future electronic waste recycling strategies to discussing the importance of understanding why diet alcoholic drinks get you drunk quicker.</description>

      <description>August marks my 6-month milestone since commencing a PhD program. As a result of this significant milestone, I thought I would use this week’s blog post to reflect on the journey so far.
When I think about what skill has helped me get to this point, two words immediately spring to mind.
Work ethic.
As a PhD student you are largely in control of your own schedule and you can direct your own hours.</description>

      <description>Words are incredible. Words can be used to express ideas, comfort others, inspire movements to spark change, create music that can unite people from different cultures…the list goes on. Equally so, however, words can be used to spread misinformation, cause confusion that leads to conflict and distrust, especially when taken out of context.
You may be wondering why I am talking about words when the title of this article is about scientists and public engagement?</description>

      <description>When I teach students, I take the same level of responsibility, care and commitment towards their learning and development as I would hope another teacher would show my future children. This can, at times, be emotionally arduous, when such a heavy investment is put into relationships that are inherently transient with every calendar year. However, the immense joy in seeing the professional and personal development of my students is what motivates me to keep working on my craft.</description>
