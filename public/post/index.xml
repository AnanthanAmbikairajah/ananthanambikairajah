      <description>When I teach students, I take the same level of responsibility, care and commitment towards their learning and development as I would hope another teacher would show my future children. This can, at times, be emotionally arduous, when such a heavy investment is put into relationships that are inherently transient with every calendar year. However, the immense joy in seeing the professional and personal development of my students is what motivates me to keep working on my craft.</description>

      <description>Words are incredible. Words can be used to express ideas, comfort others, inspire movements to spark change, create music that can unite people from different culturesâ€¦the list goes on. Equally so, however, words can be used to spread misinformation, cause confusion that leads to conflict and distrust, especially when taken out of context.
You may be wondering why I am talking about words when the title of this article is about scientists and public engagement?</description>
