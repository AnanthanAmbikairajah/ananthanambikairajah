Fat-mass continues to increase in middle-age women but menopause isn’t to blame, according to new research from The Australian National University (ANU).</p>
<p>Mr Ananthan Ambikairajah, a PhD Scholar from ANU, says post-menopausal women do have higher belly fat compared to premenopausal women, which could increase their risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia.</p>
<p>“Older women can experience weight gain for many reasons. However, menopause is not one of them,” said Mr Ananthan Ambikairajah, from the Research School of Population Health.</p>
<p>“The advice is to watch your shape, as well as your weight.”</p>
<p>The research has debunked the widespread myth that menopause causes weight gain - and found that a weight redistribution occurs.</p>
<p>“This change in distribution of bodyweight happens post-menopause and there is an accumulation of visceral fat around the stomach,” said Mr Ambikairajah.</p>
<p>“This study found that total leg fat percentage decreased for women after menopause but trunk-fat percentage increased.”</p>
<p>Previous research has shown women are at a higher risk of dementia than men. People who are overweight at midlife are also at higher risk of dementia.</p>
<p>High amounts of fat around the stomach are also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>“Cardiovascular disease is often thought of as a male dominated disease but it is the leading cause of death in women worldwide,” said Mr Ambikairajah.</p>
<p>“The results may help explain why premenopausal women have lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared with men of the same age, whereas, post-menopausal women have higher risk compared to men of the same age”.</p>
<p>The study looked at weight changes in over one million women using Body Mass Index and Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) – a technology to calculate body composition – to measure body fat percentage and found menopause had “no significant influence” over total weight gain.</p>
<p>“The accumulation of that central fat is unhealthy and could be a risk factor for dementia,” said Mr Ambikairajah.</p>
<p>“There are more women with dementia than men but the reasons for that are under debate.”</p>
<p>The average age for menopause is 50-52 but women can also have it earlier or later in life.</p>
<p>“Menopause is a point in time when women stop having their period. After that women are post-menopausal,” said Mr Ambikairajah.</p>
<p>“Post-menopausal women oestrogen levels decline and we know oestrogen can protect women’s hearts and brains if used soon after menopause.”</p>
<p>Mr Ambikairajah says further research about the impacts of oestrogen and fat changes is required.</p>
<p>“I want to make sure women have all the information needed to live healthy and happy lives.”</p>
<p>The study has been published in The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The full study can be found <a href="https://ananthanambikairajah.com/files/Ambikairajah_et_al_2019_Fat_mass_changes_AJOG.pdf">here</a>.</p>
