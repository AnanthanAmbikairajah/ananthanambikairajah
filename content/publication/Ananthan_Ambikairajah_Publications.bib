  abstract = {Our objective was to distinguish ALS, ALS-FTD and bvFTD via a novel visual MRI cortical atrophy scale that can be employed in a clinical setting. MRI images of 100 participants (33 ALS, 11 ALS-FTD, 22 bvFTD and 34 controls) were rated in four brain areas: orbitofrontal cortex, anterior temporal pole, anterior cingulate, and motor cortex. Areas were rated on a 5- point Likert scale by two raters blinded to the diagnosis. Results demonstrated that bvFTD patients showed the highest levels of atrophy across all regions, while ALS patients had the lowest atrophy scores. ALS-FTD patients have higher atrophy ratings compared to ALS patients for the motor cortex, anterior cingulate and anterior temporal lobe, with a statistical trend for the orbitofrontal cortex. ALS-FTD patients were not significantly different from bvFTD for any of the brain regions. These findings were confirmed in a post hoc VBM analysis of the same participants. Our study demonstrates that a simple visual MRI rating scale can reliably distinguish ALS, ALS-FTD and bvFTD atrophy patterns in a clinical setting. Motor cortex, anterior cingulate and anterior temporal atrophy emerged as good diagnostic markers for ALS-FTD. Employment of this MRI rating scale can complement clinical diagnostics of patients in the ALS-FTD continuum.},

  shorttitle = {Fat Mass Changes during Menopause},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Data: Fat mass has been shown to increase in aging women; however, the extent to which menopausal status mediates these changes remains unclear. The purpose of this review was to determine (1) how fat mass differs in quantity and distribution between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, (2) whether and how age and/or menopausal status moderates any observed differences, and (3) which type of fat mass measure is best suited to the detection of differences in fat mass between groups. STUDY: This review with metaanalyses is reported according to Metaanalysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Studies (published up to May 2018) were identified via PubMed to provide fat mass measures in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. We included 201 cross-sectional studies in the metaanalysis, which provided a combined sample size of 1,049,919 individuals and consisted of 478,734 premenopausal women and 571,185 postmenopausal women. Eleven longitudinal studies were included in the metaanalyses, which provided a combined sample size of 2472 women who were premenopausal at baseline and postmenopausal at follow up.
RESULTS: The main findings of this review were that fat mass significantly increased between premenopausal and postmenopausal women across most measures, which included body mass index (1.14 kg/m2; 95\% confidence interval, 0.95\textendash{}1.32 kg/m2), bodyweight (1 kg; 95\% confidence interval, 0.44\textendash{}1.57 kg), body fat percentage (2.88\%; 95\% confidence interval, 2.13\textendash{}3.63\%), waist circumference (4.63 cm; 95\% confidence interval, 3.90\textendash{}5.35 cm), hip circumference (2.01 cm; 95\% confidence interval, 1.36\textendash{}2.65 cm), waist-hip ratio (0.04; 95\% confidence interval, 0.03\textendash{}0.05), visceral fat (26.90 cm2; 95\% confidence interval, 13.12\textendash{}40.68), and trunk fat percentage (5.49\%; 95\% confidence interval, 3.91\textendash{}7.06 cm2). The exception was total leg fat percentage, which significantly decreased (\textendash{}3.19\%; 95\% confidence interval, \textendash{}5.98 to \textendash{}0.41\%). No interactive effects were observed between menopausal status and age across all fat mass measures.
CONCLUSION: The change in fat mass quantity between premenopausal and postmenopausal women was attributable predominantly to increasing age; menopause had no significant additional influence. However, the decrease in total leg fat percentage and increase in measures of central fat are indicative of a possible change in fat mass distribution after menopause. These changes are likely to, at least in part, be due to hormonal shifts that occur during midlife when women have a higher androgen (ie, testosterone) to estradiol ratio after menopause, which has been linked to enhanced central adiposity deposition. Evidently, these findings suggest attention should be paid to the accumulation of central fat after menopause, whereas increases in total fat mass should be monitored consistently across the lifespan.},

  abstract = {Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), also known as growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), is a stress response cytokine. MIC-1/GDF15 is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and increased levels of MIC-1/GDF15 are associated with a variety of diseases including cognitive decline. Furthermore, Mic-1/Gdf15 knockout mice (Mic-1 KO) weigh more, have increased adiposity, associated with increased spontaneous food intake, and exhibit reduced basal energy expenditure and physical activity. The current study was designed to comprehensively determine the role of MIC-1/GDF15 on behavioural domains of male and female knockout mice including locomotion, exploration, anxiety, cognition, social behaviours, and sensorimotor gating. Mic-1 KO mice exhibited a task-dependent increase in locomotion and exploration and reduced anxiety-related behaviours across tests. Spatial working memory and social behaviours were not affected by Mic-1/Gdf15 deficiency. Interestingly, knockout mice formed an increased association with the conditioned stimulus in fear conditioning testing and also displayed significantly improved prepulse inhibition. Overall sex effects were evident for social behaviours, fear conditioning, and sensorimotor gating. This is the first study defining the role of Mic-1/Gdf15 in a number of behavioural domains. Whether the observed impact is based on direct actions of Mic-1/Gdf15 deficiency on the CNS or whether the behavioural effects are mediated by indirect actions on e.g. other neurotransmitter systems must be clarified in future studies.},

  shorttitle = {Lipid Profile Differences during Menopause},
  abstract = {Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine lipid profile differences between premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Methods: The present review used a meta-analytic approach. Sixty-six studies were included, which provided a total sample of 114,655 women consisting of 68,394 that were premenopausal and 46,261 that were postmenopausal.
Results: The main findings were that (1) lipoproteins were significantly higher in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women including triglycerides (0.27 mmol/L, 95\% confidence interval, 0.22-0.31), total cholesterol (0.58, 0.50-0.65), low-density lipoprotein (0.45, 0.38-0.53), and total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein levels (0.39, 0.16-0.62); (2) there was no difference in high-density lipoprotein levels between premenopausal and postmenopausal women (0.02, {\`A}0.00-0.04); and (3) the differences in lipid levels was partly attributable to the mean age difference between premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Conclusions: These findings are important as they provide precise estimates of lipid differences in women around menopause. Furthermore the results suggest that the unfavorable lipid profile that develops in postmenopausal women puts them at higher risk of cardiovascular disease such as heart disease and stroke if appropriate lifestyle/pharmacological interventions are not implemented.},
