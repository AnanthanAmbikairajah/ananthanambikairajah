The founder of The Big Brother Scholarship, Mr Ananthan Ambikairajah, is an old boy of Sydney Technical High School. Ananthan is a neuroscientist, educator and professional speaker who has taught in both high school and university environments. He has had extensive experience in mentoring, motivating and engaging students. Ananthan has been accepted into a PhD program at the Australian National University in Canberra and has been awarded an Australian Government Research Training Program (AGRTP) stipend scholarship, to pursue research in the field of neuroscience. As a result of this, he has decided to use some of this money to make a positive impact. This has led to the conceptualisation of The Big Brother Scholarship.     

The goal of The Big Brother Scholarship is to provide support for a student who is in need of some form of mentorship in their lives. This support will include a $500 stipend, in addition to monthly mentoring sessions, to help students with either their personal or professional lives. These monthly mentoring sessions will broadly be focused around goal setting activities, in addition to developing the skills to establish a strong professional and/or personal network so that students can achieve their goals.    

The Big Brother Scholarship also aims to provide all prospective applicants with an opportunity to gain experience with key elements of an application process. Prospective applicants will gain experience with writing a personal statement, creating a resume, getting a document certified, reaching out to potential referees and responding to written application questions. The process of applying for The Big Brother Scholarship will provide prospective applicants with valuable feedback and insights, which will help facilitate their professional development.    

Applications close 5pm, April 15th, 2021.
